# Collatz Conjecture Calculator

This Java program calculates the Collatz sequence for a given starting number and stops after 500 iterations or when the sequence reaches the value 1. The Collatz sequence, also known as the 3n + 1 sequence, is a well-known mathematical sequence with an unsolved conjecture regarding its behavior.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the program with Java:
```bash
javac collatz_conjecture.java
java collatz_conjecture
```

3. Enter a positive integer >1 as the starting number when prompted.
4. The program will calculate the Collatz sequence and stop after 500 iterations or when it reaches 1.

Note
This program is designed for educational purposes and serves as a simple demonstration of the Collatz sequence. It may not be optimized for extremely large input values and is not intended for production use.
